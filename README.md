Mog is a modern blogging system that is easy to extend. It breaks through the use of microservice architecture, in the structure design is modular and flexible. You can easily customize it to meet your needs. More can be through the interface to develop their own front/middle background, can also be through the plug-in to develop their own functions.

## Missions

There are a lot of blogging systems for users on the market, but it seems that they all follow the same route, and we want to break through this limitation. For this reason, we used a microservice architecture, which was the first time our team had used it for a blogging system, and it brought stability and flexibility to the services that we didn't have on the market.

![module+blog=mog](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62133302/197695513-f00fc858-be06-4fce-8a28-c22838a76a2b.png)

Another reason is actually to see some paid blogging system projects, but those projects don't seem to be worth it as a paid project, we don't want so many people to pay for a project that is not very good, it's not worth it. And as far as we know, the underlying framework used by some charging projects is not secure because of anti-sequence vulnerabilities.

We also is not say which good or bad, but don't think there's a certain charge blog project is stable, for users need to choose carefully, once bought a bug is a blog that is not good, but open source blog system, first of all, you can guarantee the community driven. Second, you can enjoy the benefits of open source, such as no fees, more maintenance members, uniform specifications, etc.
